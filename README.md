# Coding Quiz

A coding quiz application made from JavaScript, with html and bootstrap css.

# Description

This project was made for challenge #4 in the UNCC Web Development boot-camp. The goal of this application was to code a timed quiz that tests JavaScript fundamentals and stores the scores of the user. I was not supplied any code and had to create everything from scratch.

# Final Thoughts

This challenge was tough for me because I ended up falling very far behind for weeks 4 and 5 due to a mix of sickness and technical problems. I wasn't sure that I would be able to complete it on my own due to not being entirely through the week 4 lessons by the point of submission. I had to rely on the internet to find another application so that I could reverse engineer how that developer created it. I hope to return to this challenge in the future and redo it once I have a better understanding of how to create an application like this.
